# Distributed-Hash-Table-Based-Content-Searching-in-a-Structured-Peer-to-Peer-Network-
The goal of this project is to develop a TCP based structured-overlay-based solution that allows a set of nodes to share contents among each other. A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based content/resource discovery system for a structured P2P network has been implemented.
